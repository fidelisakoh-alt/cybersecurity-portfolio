# Labs

This folder contains hands-on technical exercises completed as part of my cybersecurity training.

The labs focus on practical skills such as:
- Network traffic analysis
- Protocol inspection
- Command-line investigation
- Interpreting security-relevant evidence

Each lab documents **what was observed and how it was analysed**, without incident judgement or business impact.  
Where applicable, labs are linked to related incident journal entries that apply analytical reasoning to the findings.

## How to Read These Labs

- Labs = **evidence and technical analysis**
- Incident Journal = **interpretation, impact, and escalation**

This separation reflects real-world security operations, where analysts first gather evidence before documenting incidents.
