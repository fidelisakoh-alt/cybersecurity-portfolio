# Labs

This section contains hands-on technical exercises focused on network security, traffic analysis, and attack identification.  
Each lab documents observations, protocol-level analysis, and conclusions based on simulated or real-world inspired scenarios.

The purpose of these labs is to demonstrate practical cybersecurity skills and analytical thinking.

The labs focus on developing practical technical skills such as:

- Network traffic analysis
- Protocol inspection
- Command-line investigation
- Interpreting security-relevant evidence
