# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Starter

**Professional Statement:**  
[I am a motivated learner transitioning into cybersecurity, where I can combine creativity, analytical thinking, and empathy for users to help organisations defend against threats. As a product designer, I focused on enriching customer experiences by understanding people’s needs; now I want to extend that same care by protecting their data and privacy while aligning with business security goals. I am committed to ethical standards and building resilient systems that safeguard both people and organisations.]
