# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Starter

Welcome! This is a tidy, job‑ready structure for your cybersecurity portfolio. 
Fill it as you progress through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

## Structure
- `projects/` — Polished case studies (end‑to‑end stories with outcomes)
- `labs/` — Hands‑on exercises (Linux, SQL, Wireshark, SIEM, etc.)
- `audits/` — Security audits & governance work
- `vuln-assessments/` — Vulnerability findings & small-business assessments
- `incident-journal/` — Incident handler’s journal entries
- `templates/` — Re-usable write‑up templates
- `assets/` — Redacted screenshots & sample (non‑sensitive) data

> ⚠️ Never include sensitive, private, or proprietary information. Redact screenshots and sanitise data.
