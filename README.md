# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Professional Statement
I am an early-career cybersecurity analyst building practical skills in network security, incident analysis, and security fundamentals.  
I approach security with a strong focus on clarity, critical thinking, and responsible handling of data.

This portfolio documents hands-on labs, incident analyses, and structured write-ups that demonstrate how I investigate security events, interpret network traffic, and communicate findings clearly.

## About This Repository
This repository contains practical cybersecurity work inspired by real-world scenarios and industry-standard practices.  
It focuses on **how incidents are analysed**, **how conclusions are reached**, and **how findings are documented**, rather than tool output alone.

The goal is to show how I think, not just what I run.
