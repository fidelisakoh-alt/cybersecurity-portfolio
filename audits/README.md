# Security Audits & Risk Assessments

This folder contains security risk assessments and network hardening reviews.

The focus of these documents is on identifying security weaknesses, evaluating risk, and recommending preventative controls that reduce the likelihood and impact of future incidents.

Unlike hands-on labs, the work in this folder emphasises:
- Risk identification
- Security control selection
- Preventative hardening strategies
- Clear, written justification of security decisions

These assessments are written from the perspective of a security analyst advising an organisation on how to improve its security posture.
